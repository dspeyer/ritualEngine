    "A possible child,\nDreaming through the longest night,",
    "A possible smile,\nWaking to a distant light,\n ",
    "A possible world,\nTell me what you want to see,",
    "Where's that child going, tell me\nWho's that child gonna be...\n ",
    "In five thousand years,",
    "Whatcha want to do, whatcha want to see?",
    "In five thousand years",
    "Where we want to go, who we want to be?\n ",
    "In five thousand years,",
    "If we boldly set our sights",
    "And journey through the coldest night",
    "In five thousand years...\n ",
    "Oh...\n ",
    "Five thousand years...\n ",
    "We could build a brand new home,",
    "We could raise the glass domes high.",
    "And in a century or three",
    "Our children might look at the sky\n ",
    "And then at last they'd see",
    "The distant yellow sun.",
    "The cradle of humanity,",
    "And all the things we might become...\n ",
    "In five thousand years",
    "Whatcha want to do, whatcha want to see, in another",
    "Five thousand years",
    "Where we want to go, who we want to be, in another\n ",
    "Five thousand years",
    "If we sailed across the stars,",
    "Unimaginably far",
    "In five thousand years...\n ",
    "Oh...",
    "Five thousand years...\n ",
    "And maybe good folk still might die,",
    "But maybe not, we gotta try",
    "I don't quite know what shape we'll take",
    "I don't quite know what world we'll make\n ",
    "I don't quite know how things might change",
    "I don't quite know what rules we'd break",
    "Our present selves might think it strange",
    "But there's so many lives at stake...\n ",
    "And entropy is bearin' down",
    "But we got tricks for stickin' around.",
    "And if our children see the day",
    "That yellow fades to red then grey,\n ",
    "We'll take a moment, one by one",
    "Turn to face the dying su-un",
    "Bittersweetly wave goodbye--",
    "The journey's only just begun...\n ",
    "In five thousand years",
    "Whatcha want to do, whatcha want to see, in another",
    "Five million years",
    "Where we want to go, who we want to be, in another\n ",
