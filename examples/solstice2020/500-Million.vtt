0
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.799
We will never know their names. 

1
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.089
The first victim could not have
been recorded, for there was no

2
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.799
written language to record it.

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.999
But they were somebody's
daughter,

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.799
or father, 

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.499
or friend. 

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.199
They were loved by people
around them.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.399
And they were in pain, 

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.399
covered in rashes, 

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.289
confused and scared, not
knowing why this was happening

10
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.999
to them or how they could stop
it,

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.499
the victim of a mad inhuman god. 

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.899
There was nothing to be done. 

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.199
Humanity was not strong enough, 

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.799
not aware enough, 

15
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.889
not knowledgeable enough 

16
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.299
to fight back against a monster
that it could not see.

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.649
Not yet.

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.399
In ancient Egypt, it struck
slave and Pharaoh alike.

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.399
In Rome, 

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.499
it effortlessly decimated
armies.

21
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.299
It killed in Syria, in Moscow.
In India, five million dead.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.088
It killed a thousand Europeans
every day in the eighteenth

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.699
century.

24
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.899
It killed more than fifty
million Native Americans.

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.999
From the Peloponnesian War to
the Civil War,

26
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.799
it slew more soldiers and
civilians than any weapon,

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.099
any soldier, any army. 

28
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.899
Cultures grew and faltered, and
it remained.

29
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.389
Empires rose and fell, and it
thrived.

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.599
Ideologies waxed and waned, and
it did not care.

31
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.599
Kill. Maim. Spread. Multiply. 

32
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.099
An ancient mad god,

33
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.288
hidden from view, that could
not be fought,

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.599
could not be confronted, could
not even be comprehended.

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.099
Not the only one of its kind, 

36
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.899
but the most devastating. 

37
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.399
For a long time there was no
hope,

38
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.899
only the bitter hollow
endurance of survivors.

39
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.799
In China, in the tenth century,
humanity began to fight back.

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.589
We learned that survivors of
the mad god's curse would

41
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.899
never be touched again.

42
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.089
They had taken a portion of
that power into themselves,

43
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.099
and were protected by it.

44
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.589
Not only that, but the power
could be shared by consuming a

45
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.899
remnant of their wounds.

46
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.589
There was a price, for you
could not take the god's power

47
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.299
without first defeating it, but
it was a smaller battle,

48
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.799
on humanity's terms. 

49
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.889
And by the sixteenth century,
the technique spread

50
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.799
to India, across Asia, 

51
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.099
the Ottoman Empire, Europe. 

52
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.289
In 1796, a more powerful
technique was discovered by

53
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.299
Edward Jenner,

54
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.999
and an idea began to take hold. 

55
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.599
Perhaps the ancient god could
be killed.

56
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.899
A whisper became a voice, 

57
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.699
a voice became a call, 

58
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.189
a call became a battle cry 

59
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.799
echoing across villages, cities,
and nations.

60
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.089
Humanity began to cooperate, 

61
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.389
spreading the protective power
across the globe,

62
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.299
dispatching masters to protect
whole populations.

63
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.899
Sworn enemies joined in common
cause for this one battle,

64
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.889
their governments mandating
that all citizens protect

65
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.489
themselves, for giving the
enemy even a single life would

66
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.099
put millions in danger.

67
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.999
And inch by inch we drove our
enemy back.

68
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.199
Fewer friends wept, fewer
neighbors were crippled,

69
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.799
fewer parents had to bury their
children.

70
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.399
At the dawn of the twentieth
century, for the first time,

71
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.599
we banished smallpox from
entire regions of the world.

72
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.299
We faltered many times in our
efforts.

73
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.399
But there were individuals who
never gave up,

74
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.989
who fought for the dream of a
world where no child or loved

75
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.739
one would ever fear the demon
again.

76
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.559
Victor Zhdanov,

77
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.999
who called for humanity to
unite in a final push.

78
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.699
The great tactician Karel RaÅ¡ka, 

79
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.899
who conceived of a strategy to
annihilate the enemy.

80
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.199
Donald Henderson, 

81
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.799
who led the efforts in those
final days.

82
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.499
The enemy grew weaker. 

83
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.199
Millions became thousands,
thousands became dozens.

84
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.389
And then when the enemy did
strike, scores of humans came

85
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.399
forth to defy it, protecting
all it might endanger.

86
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.699
Smallpox's last attack in the
wild was on Ali Maow Maalin,

87
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.398
in 1977. 

88
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.299
For months afterwards, 

89
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.089
we swept the surrounding area,
seeking out any last desperate

90
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.999
hiding place

91
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.999
where the enemy might remain. 

92
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.499
And we found none. 

93
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.899
On December 9th, 1979, 

94
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.799
humanity declared victory. 

95
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.599
The horror from beyond memory, 

96
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.289
the monster that took five
hundred million people from

97
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.399
this world,

98
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.899
was destroyed. 

99
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.699
You are a member of the species
that did that.

100
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.799
Never forget what we are
capable of

101
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.699
when we band together 

102
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.899
and declare battle on what is
broken in this world.
