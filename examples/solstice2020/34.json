    "Hands chip the flint, light the fire, skin the kill",
    "Feet move the tribe track the herd with a will",
    "Humankind struggles on the edge of history",
    "Time to settle down, time to grow, time to breed",
    " ",
    "Plow tills the soil, plants the seed, pray for rain",
    "Scythe reaps the wheat, to the mill, to grind the grain",
    "Towns and cities spread to empire overnight",
    "Hands keep building as we chant the ancient rite",
    " ",
    "Coal heats the steam, push the piston, turns the wheel",
    "Cogs spin the wool, drives the horses made of steel",
    "Lightning harnessed does our will and lights the dark",
    "Keep rising higher, set our goal, hit the mark.",
    " ",
    "Crawl out of the mud,",
    "Ongoing but slow,",
    "For the path that is easy",
    "Ain't the one that lets us grow!",
    " ",
    "Light to push the sails, read the data, cities glow",
    "Hands type the keys, click the mouse, out we go!",
    "Our voices carry round the world and into space",
    "Send us out to colonize another placeÂ¸",
    " ",
    "Tools make the tools, build the fire, plant the grain.",
    "Drones track the herd, build a world, begin again."
